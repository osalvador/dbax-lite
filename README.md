## What is the dbax lite Framework?
dbax Lite Framework is a PL/SQL MVC system. It's designed to be lightweight and modular, allowing developers to build better and easy to maintain code with PL/SQL to develop web applications. 

## Features

* [x] MVC;which allows great separation between logic and presentation. 
* [x] [Routing](docs/Routing.md); simple but powerfull url routing. The URLs generated by dbax are clean and search-engine friendly.
* [x] Modular (you can choose which components to use).
* [x] Write SQL and PL/SQL. Use all PL/SQL libraries you like.
* [x] Lightweight.
* [x] Template Engine; dbax uses [tePLSQL](https://github.com/osalvador/tePLSQL) which has the same syntax as [Oracle PSP](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e41502/adfns_psp.htm#ADFNS016).
* [x] Fast; dbax has been developed on top of PL/SQL Web Toolkit.
* [x] Free; dbax is licensed under the LGPL license so you can use it however you please.

## Examples 

### Hello World

Simply create the application front controller procedure and invoke the router.

```sql      
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE hello (name_array    IN owa_util.vc_arr DEFAULT dbx.empty_vc_arr
                                 , value_array   IN owa_util.vc_arr DEFAULT dbx.empty_vc_arr )
AS
   -- Unique application ID Name
   l_appid CONSTANT   VARCHAR2 (100) := 'HELLO';
BEGIN
   -- Aplication properties
   dbx.set_property('error_style', 'DebugStyle');   
   -- dbax framework kernel 
   dbx.dispatcher (p_appid     => l_appid
                 , name_array  => name_array
                 , value_array => value_array
                 , router      => 'PK_APP_HELLO.ROUTER');
END hello;
/

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE pk_app_hello
AS   
   FUNCTION router
      RETURN CLOB;
END;
/

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY pk_app_hello
AS
   FUNCTION router
      RETURN CLOB
   AS
   BEGIN
      if route_.get ('/')
      then
       return 'Hello World from dbax';
      end if;      
   END;
END;
/
```
